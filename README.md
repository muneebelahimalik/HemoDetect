# **HemoDetect**
## Empowering Precision Medicine through Multi-Class Disease Classification of Blood Cell Images
HemoDetect is an advanced deep-learning solution built on the Faster R-CNN framework, specifically designed to revolutionize disease diagnosis and classification in the field of hematology. By leveraging state-of-the-art artificial intelligence algorithms, HemoDetect enables accurate and efficient identification of multiple diseases, including leukemia, sickle cell anemia, and malaria, from microscopic blood cell images. With its robust and precise disease classification capabilities, HemoDetect empowers healthcare professionals with a powerful tool for early detection and accurate diagnosis, allowing for personalized treatment plans and improved patient outcomes.

## Data Source
The model was trained on 10,000+ images of peripheral blood cells belonging to healthy patients and patients suffering form Leukemia, Sickle-Cell anemia and Malaria. The dataset was prepared by the [Barcelona Hematology Institute](https://en.dexeus.com/who-we-are/our-centers/barcelona). The blood cell images were annotated by expert Clinical Pathologists from [The Cl√≠nic's Institute of Hematological and Oncological Diseases](https://www.clinicbarcelona.org/en/institute/the-clinics-institute-of-hematological-and-oncological-diseases). The size of the images is 360 x 360 pixels and they are in the .jpg format.
